# macOS Security Research Preparation Guide

A comprehensive course to prepare for the Offensive Security macOS Researcher certification. This guide provides detailed lessons on macOS internals, security models, vulnerability research, and exploitation techniques.

## Course Overview

This preparation guide consists of self-paced lessons covering the fundamental knowledge and practical skills needed for macOS security research. Each lesson includes detailed explanations, diagrams, code examples, and hands-on exercises.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Unix/Linux systems
- Familiarity with at least one programming language (preferably C/C++ or Objective-C)

## Setting Up the Learning Environment

Each lesson includes detailed setup instructions for the required tools and environment. Generally, you'll need:

1. A Mac running a recent version of macOS (or a VM)
2. Xcode and Command Line Tools
3. Homebrew package manager
4. Various debugging and security tools (specific instructions provided in lessons)

## How to Use This Guide

1. Work through the lessons sequentially, as each builds upon knowledge from previous ones
2. Complete all hands-on exercises to reinforce concepts through practical application
3. Refer to the solution guides if you get stuck, but attempt exercises yourself first
4. Use the additional resources provided in each lesson to deepen your understanding
